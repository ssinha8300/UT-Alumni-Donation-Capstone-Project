# UT-Alumni-Donation-Capstone-Project

This project was my final project in my undergraduate capstone class completed in May 2022. We were provided data on past UT alumni donations up to 2021, with the option to either predict the donation amount for 2022, or predicting whether or not a specific alumni will donate. My chosen route was to predict the donation amount. We also had to determine the charasteristics of a typical alumni donor.

This project contains the R files that conducted feature engineering for new variables (with help from the professor), all the model tuning and running of models for the associated Kaggle competition within the class, the Tableau file of data visualizations, and the final report of the findings.
